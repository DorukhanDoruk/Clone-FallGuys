# Competitive Bots
I needed to add bots to put the player in a competitive mode, again I could do it in many different ways. The first idea that came to my mind was to use NavMeshAgent, but it was very restrictive in what I wanted to do. While searching for an alternative solution I came across the "[A* Pathfinding Project](https://arongranberg.com/astar/)", It's pretty simple to use and allowed me to do whatever I wanted.Finally, another method that I know of is [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), in short, it is a very good alternative to create, develop and use a Neural Network. However, I did not choose it because I did not have enough time and wanted to use the latest version, but the Unity version I was using was not compatible with it.

# Surface Drawing & Painting
I chose to create a 2D texture and fill in the UV map of this texture in order to paint on surfaces.we could use shader instead, we could get better quality result, as "[Splatoon](https://splatoon.nintendo.com/)" uses this method.In addition, we can access a similar method [Here](https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/mesh-texture-painting-in-unity-using-shaders-8eb7fc31221c).
